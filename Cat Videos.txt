Cat Videos

Recently came across two cat videos that seemed pretty interesting. The first was a little on the sweet side, because it [featured a momma cat cuddling](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F1471776339706398%2Fpermalink%2F1504088116475220%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGnrdH6SMyxkdD8wws6ejn03xrv2w) her kitten who apparently was having a nightmare. What do cats have nightmares about, anyways?

Next, there was an entertaining video which simulated [what life would be like if cats said “hey” instead of “meow.”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F1471776339706398%2Fpermalink%2F1503909919826373%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH1YagFy1vLGQBF4hGbDvD34k5EhA) Personally, I don’t think that it would be an improvement, really.
