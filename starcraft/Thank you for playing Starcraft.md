Wanted to say how much I’ve enjoyed playing Starcraft with you guys during the last few months. I hung onto the game thinking that it might come in handy, but I never guessed that years later I’d be versing my thirteen-year-old daughter or eleven-year-old son.

I bought “Starcraft” during a period in my life when I actually had the extra time to play video games. I had just graduated college, but knew your mom, so this would have been around 1997 or 98. At the time, I was working at my very first job out of college, HomeTown Online. I’d work on websites and answer the phones during the day, then hang out in my bedroom up in my parents’ house fighting battles against the Zerg and the Protoss.

I became hooked on war strategy video games when my college roommate, after watching my roommate, Ed, play “Warcraft.” This was basically the same thing, only with humans fighting against trolls and orcs. It used to drive Ed nuts watching me try to play, because I’d get so wrapped up into building villages and collecting resources that I’d almost forget to actually fight anybody. I was the same way with “Starcraft.”

I did play Starcraft against your mom once, remotely. I was astonished by how fast the gaming speed was, and back then I connected via a modem. I’m pretty sure that I won.

We take a lot of today’s technology for granted. Back when “Starcraft” was released, the only way you could hold any sort of tournament in the same room is if you had a network set up, cables, and other equipment. Compare that to our set up right in the dining room with two laptops connected to each other through wifi.

I slowed down on my video game playing around 2000 after we had gotten married and moved into our apartment in Haslett. I began realizing that hours devoted to playing a video game really didn’t amount to much. There were way more productive ways to spend my time. For me, that was a point where I set aside the video game and tried to write more.

But, I’ve valued the time that I’ve spent playing against you because it was time spent with you. It has also been exciting sharing a little bit of my past with you.
